<p>
    One of Brad's favorite hobbies is LARPing. He enjoys getting to dress up and show off what he can do with a bow and a dagger when he gets the chance. You can see here that he likes to use his bow and takes a clean shot.
</p>

<P>
    You can also see here that he runs around quite a bit and will use both his dagger and bow at the same time. Able to hold both in one hand well shooting and able to then shift and use the bow with his free hand.
